# Plant Disease Detection for Sustainable Agriculture

This project implements a Plant Disease Detection system using a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is used to detect diseases in plant leaves, with a focus on potato plants. The app uses Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface for uploading plant images and getting predictions in real-time.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required for the project:

- **TensorFlow**: Used to build, train, and use deep learning models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
- **opencv-python-headless**: OpenCV library for image processing.
- **ipykernel**: The kernel used to run Python code interactively (typically required in Jupyter notebooks or environments like Streamlit).
- **matplotlib**: Used for visualizing results like training accuracy and loss.

### Install the Required Libraries

You can install all the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python-headless ipykernel matplotlib
streamlit run web.py
  ```
